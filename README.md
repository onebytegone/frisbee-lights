# Frisbee Lights

This is a LED bracket that attaches to a frisbee. The goal is to make it possible to play frisbee at night.

### Supplies

  * 1x 3D-printed frame ([assembled.stl](exports/assembled.stl))
  * 4x 5mm LED in color of your choice
  * 1x Resistor (Might not be needed depending on the LEDs)
  * 1x CR2032 coin cell
  * Wire


## Current version report

v1.1 has lasted for about 2hr of fairly rough play from the frisbee's standpoint that is. This is an improvement over v1.0 which started to have issues after ~45min and failed at about the 2hr mark.

One downside with v1.1, it seems to be heavier than v1.0. It appears to impact the flight of the disc a little more than I would like. Don't have any hard data on this however.

_Update 2015-12-05:_ v1.1 finally failed due to one of the arms braking. This is the same issue that killed v1.0. Possible solutions to this for v1.2 are increase arm thickness, drastically reduce the arm length, or switch to SMD LED's to reduce the arm height profile.


## Changelog

  * v1.1 - Adjusted with notes form v1.0
    * Has wider arms, LED supports, and a cutout for the wires to slide in
    * Requires some glue for assembly
    * Arms still tend to break off
  * v1.0 - Initial Design
    * Lasted for about 2hr of ultimate frisbee
    * LEDs tend to bend
    * Assembly is hard due to solder joints in the clip
    * 1 arm was broken off in play
