# Frisbee Lights

This is a LED bracket that attaches to a frisbee. The goal is to make it possible to play frisbee at night.

### Supplies

  * 1x 3D-printed frame ([assembled.stl](exports/assembled.stl))
  * 4x 5mm LED in color of your choice
  * 1x Resistor (Might not be needed depending on the LEDs)
  * 1x CR2032 coin cell
  * Wire


## Current version report

So far, v1.1 has lasted for about 2hr of fairly rough play from the frisbee's standpoint that is. This is an improvement over v1.0 which started to have issues after ~45min and failed at about the 2hr mark.

One downside with v1.1, it seems to be heavier than v1.0. It appears to impact the flight of the disc a little more than I would like. Don't have any hard data on this however.


## Changelog

  * v1.1 - Adjusted with notes form v1.0
    * Has wider arms, LED supports, and a cutout for the wires to slide in
    * Requires some glue for assembly
  * v1.0 - Initial Design
    * Lasted for about 2hr of ultimate frisbee
    * LEDs tend to bend
    * Assemby is hard due to solder joints in the clip
    * 1 arm was broken off in play
