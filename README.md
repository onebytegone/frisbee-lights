# Frisbee Lights

This is a LED bracket that attaches to a frisbee. The goal is to make it possible to play frisbee at night.

### Supplies

  * 1x 3D-printed frame ([assembled.stl](exports/assembled.stl))
  * 2x 5mm LED in color of your choice (4x where needed for < v2.0)
  * 1x Resistor (Might not be needed depending on the LEDs)
  * 1x CR2032 coin cell
  * Wire


## Current version report

v1.1 has lasted for about 2hr of fairly rough play from the frisbee's standpoint that is. This is an improvement over v1.0 which started to have issues after ~45min and failed at about the 2hr mark.

One downside with v1.1, it seems to be heavier than v1.0. It appears to impact the flight of the disc a little more than I would like. Don't have any hard data on this however.

_Update 2015-12-05:_ v1.1 finally failed due to one of the arms braking. This is the same issue that killed v1.0. Possible solutions to this for v1.2 are increase arm thickness, drastically reduce the arm length, or switch to SMD LED's to reduce the arm height profile.

_Update 2015-12-08:_ With v2.0, it is fairly easy to mount the unit using a piece of clear packing tape over the top. It is a little unstable on the side with the battery slot. To fix this, I'm recommending a small tab under the front of the battery slot to assist in mounting. For now, a piece of tape can go into the battery slot to hold that side down.

_Update 2015-12-09:_ Using packing tape, over gaphers tape, seemed like a good idea. It tends to fail easily though. Either the frisbee needs to be prepped better or a different, or just stronger, tape is needed.
